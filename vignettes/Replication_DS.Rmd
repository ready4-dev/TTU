# Origin and purpose of youthu replication dataset
The replication dataset distributed with the youthu package is a purely synthetic (entirely fake) dataset that is nonetheless representative (in terms of constituent variables and their uni-variate and [to some extent] joint distributions) of the original study dataset that we used to derive the transfer to utility algorithms included in youthu. The purpose of the replication dataset is two-fold:

1) to help users replicate the results in our original study (by applying the same algorithms we used to a different but similar dataset, users will be able to get broadly similar results);

2) to help users trial the functions in the youthu package before potentially applying these functions to their own data.

# Replication dataset dictionary

An overview of the contents of the replication dataset is provided in a data dictionary that can be accessed with the following command.

```{r message=FALSE}
dictionary_tb <- youthu::repln_ds_dict_r3
```

The following lines print the data dictionary as a table.

```{r ddic}
dictionary_tb %>%
  ready4show::print_table(output_type_1L_chr = "HTML", 
                          caption_1L_chr = "Data dictionary",  
                          use_lbls_as_col_nms_1L_lgl = T, 
                          mkdn_tbl_ref_1L_chr = "tab:ddic")
```

# Accessing the replication dataset
The replication dataset itself can be accessed using the following command.

```{r}
raw_data_tb <- youthu::replication_popl_tb 
```

Adding variable labels makes it easier to interpret the dataset. In the following command, we add lables from the data dictionary to the replication dataset.

```{r }
raw_data_tb <- raw_data_tb %>%
  ready4use::add_labels_from_dictionary(dictionary_tb)
```

The following command prints the first ten cases from the replication dataset as a table, using variable labels as column names.

```{r repds}
raw_data_tb %>%
  head() %>%
  ready4show::print_table(output_type_1L_chr = "HTML",
                          caption_1L_chr = "Replication dataset", 
                          use_lbls_as_col_nms_1L_lgl = T, 
                          mkdn_tbl_ref_1L_chr = "tab:repds") 
```
