**The TTU package is currently undergoing significant redevelopment. Many of the functions previously included in the package have been replaced by methods in the [specific package](https://ready4-dev.github.io/specific).  More information will be poster here shortly.** 

This development version of the TTU package has been made available as part of the process of testing and documenting the package. [Installation instructions are on the package homepage](https://ready4-dev.github.io/TTU/index.html).
