\\textbf{Background: }
Our study is entirely fictional and has been created to illustrate the generalisability of TTU package functions.
\\newline
\\newline
\\textbf{Objectives: }
We aimed to identify the best transfer to utility (TTU) regression models to predict EuroQol - Five Dimension (EQ-5D) utility and evaluate the predictive ability of two candidate measures of psychological distress and psychological wellbeing.
\\newline
\\newline
\\textbf{Methods: }
The study sample is fake data that pretends to be Australian young people aged 12 to 25 years. Follow-up measurements were four months after baseline. Five Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and three generalised linear models (GLMs) were explored to identify the best TTU algorithm.  Predictive ability of two candidate measures of psychological distress and psychological wellbeing were assessed using ten fold cross validation and forest models. Linear / generalised linear mixed effect models were then used to construct longitudinal predictive models for EQ-5D change.
\\newline
\\newline
\\textbf{Results: }
k10 had the highest predictive ability in ten fold cross validation and the random forest model. GLM with Binomial distribution and logit link and OLS with no transformation were the best peforming models. The mean ratio between the within-person and between-person associated coefficients was 0.97 for k10 and 0.93 for psychwell.

\\newline
\\textbf{Conclusions: }
If this study was real, the results would be really interesting.
