<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Tools for developping Transfer To Utility (TTU) mapping
algorithms to predict health utility from other health measures.  This
development version of the TTU package has been made available as part
of the process of testing and documenting the package. The tools
contained in this development release automate a number of tasks which
MODIFY THE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE OF YOUR LOCAL MACHINE.  Therefore you
should only trial this software if you feel confident that you
understand what it does and have created a sandpit area in which you
can safely undertake testing. If you have any questions, please
contact the authors (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).  The
documentation for this package has been automatically generated by the
ready4fun package and is therefore quite rudimentary. Human authored
documentation will follow in 2021.

If you plan on testing this software you can install it by running the following commands in your R console:

```r
utils::install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("ready4-dev/TTU")

```
