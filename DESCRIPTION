Description: Tools for developping Transfer To Utility (TTU) mapping
    algorithms to predict health utility from other health measures.  This
    development version of the TTU package has been made available as part
    of the process of testing and documenting the package.  Some of the
    documentation for this package has been automatically generated by the
    ready4fun package and is therefore quite rudimentary. Human edits to
    improve the quality of documentation will follow in 2021.  If you have
    any questions, please contact the authors
    (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).
