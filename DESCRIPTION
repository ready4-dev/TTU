Description: Modules from the ready4 youth mental health economic model
    (https://www.ready4-dev.com/docs/model/) that can be used to develop,
    assess, report and share utility mapping models.  Outputs produced
    through use of TTU package modules are designed to integrate with
    health economic models developed with the ready4 framework
    (https://www.ready4-dev.com/).  This development version of the TTU
    package has been made available as part of the process of testing and
    documenting the package.  If you have any questions, please contact
    the authors (matthew.hamilton1@monash.edu).
