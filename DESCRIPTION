Description: Modules from the readyforwhatsnext youth mental health
    economic model (https://readyforwhatsnext.org/) that can be used to
    develop, assess, report and share utility mapping models.  Outputs
    produced through use of TTU package modules are designed to integrate
    with health economic models developed with the ready4 framework
    (https://www.ready4-dev.com/).  This development version of the TTU
    package has been made available as part of the process of testing and
    documenting the package.  If you have any questions, please contact
    the authors (matthew.hamilton1@monash.edu).
