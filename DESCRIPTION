Description: Tools for developping, sharing and reporting Transfer To
    Utility (TTU) mapping algorithms that predict health utility from
    other health measures.  This development version of the TTU package
    has been made available as part of the process of testing and
    documenting the package.  Some of the documentation for this package
    has been automatically generated by the ready4fun package and is
    therefore quite rudimentary. Human edits to improve the quality of
    documentation will follow in 2021.  If you have any questions, please
    contact the authors (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).
